Hi, I’m Austin! I'm a self-taught (read: still learning!) web developer living in North Carolina.

I’m currently learning React, TypeScript, Express, and Node.js. I'm comfortable with the web classics - JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

Most of my personal projects have focused on the frontend, but I've recently enjoyed setting up Express servers with basic routing. Backend development is where I think the real magic happens!

Currently reading: 
  Eloquent Javascript, 
  Building APIs You Won't Hate
  Think Like A Programmer
