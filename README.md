Hi, I’m Austin! I'm a self-taught (read: actively learning!) web developer living in North Carolina.

I’m currently learning React, TypeScript, Express, and Node.js. I'm comfortable with the classic web stack - JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

Most of my personal projects have focused on the frontend, but I also enjoy setting up Express servers with basic routing. Backend development is where I think the real magic happens!

Currently reading: 
  Eloquent Javascript,
  Godel, Escher, Bach
