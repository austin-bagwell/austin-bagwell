- 👋 Hi, I’m @austin-bagwell
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... JavaScript, Node, HTML, CSS, how do make computer work?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... literally anything that you want me to ~~break~~ fix. Seriously though, give me your toddler-level JavaScript/Node tidbits and I'll squish together some hacky code to try and make it do a trick or something.
